# CI/CD Guidelines for BiteSnap

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Pipeline Requirements**: Create CI pipeline that runs on every push and pull request
- **Code Quality**: Must run `flake8` for Python linting before allowing merges
- **Build Process**: Pipeline must successfully build the application before deployment
- **Test Automation**: All tests must pass before code can be merged to main branch

## Deployment Automation (CD)

- **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize the application with proper Dockerfile
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure, or Heroku)
- **Branch Protection**: Only `main` branch should trigger automatic deployments
- **Secrets Management**: Use environment variables and CI/CD secrets for sensitive data (API keys, database URLs)
- **Deployment Triggers**: Configure automated deployment on successful main branch CI pipeline

## Monitoring and Health Checks

- **Health Endpoint**: Implement `/health` route that returns:
  - HTTP 200 status
  - Basic app info (version, status, timestamp)
  - Database connectivity check
- **Metrics Collection**: Track and expose:
  - Request count per endpoint
  - Response latency (average, p95, p99)
  - Error rates (4xx, 5xx responses)
- **Monitoring Setup**: Provide basic Prometheus config or Grafana dashboard screenshots
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with appropriate log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

## Code Quality Standards

- **Simplicity**: Keep code at junior developer level - prioritize readability over complexity
- **Environment**: Use virtual environments and requirements.txt for Python dependencies
- **Configuration**: Use environment-specific config files (dev, staging, production)
